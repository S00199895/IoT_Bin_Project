# IoT_Bin_Project

This project uses an arduino Yun, 2 IR distance interrupters, and a PIR motion sensor
with the grove kit to send data to a google spreadsheet over Wi-Fi.

SpreadSheet = https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qyy25yesqFlnQmXB5tJPd1JoPqWuW3Znv48zgeDISZI/

Inside ./ArduinoBinWeb is a mock website, which pulls data from the spreadsheet and displays
it in the browser.
